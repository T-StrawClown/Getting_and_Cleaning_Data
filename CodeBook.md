## Tidy dataset
It contains 6 record 1 for each activity (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) for each of 30 subjects. That in total produces 6x30=180 rows.

Rows are ordered by subject # and activity name in ascending order. Each row has an average value calculated for the following features from original source (in the same order as they
appear in tidy.txt):
 - tBodyAcc-mean()-X
 - tBodyAcc-mean()-Y

### Data Set Information
The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. 

### Attribute Information
For each record in the dataset it is provided: 
 - Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration. 
 - Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
 - A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
 - Its activity label. 
 - An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

### Files Included
 - 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.
 - 'features.txt': List of all features.
 - 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.
 - 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.
 - 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.
